The goal of this assignment is to make a program that will turn an LED on at 50% duty cycle, and increase it by 10% everytime a button is pressed. This would increase the brightness until it was at 100%, then turn off the LED and begin the process again from 0% duty cycle. In addition to this, the button's signal was also debounced to ensure better performance. For this, a timer was used in order to debounce the button, and another timer was set up to use the built in pwm function. This was done by simply chosing an LED that was compatible with the built in pwm signal and selecting the pwm mode for that pin. The differences between the FR and G2 boards were just the pin numbers that were compatible with the built in pwm feature.
