The goal of this assignment is to make a program that will turn an LED on at 50% duty cycle, and increase it by 10% everytime a button is pressed. This would increase the brightness until it was at 100%, then turn off the LED and begin the process again from 0% duty cycle. In addition to this, the button's signal was also debounced to ensure better performance. To do this, a timer was set up in order to debounce the button and another timer was set up to send the pwm signal to the LED. The output mode of the pwm timer had to be changed in order to turn the LED on and off at the desired duty cycle. The differences in the code for the FR and G2 boards were again, the pin numbers of the LED and button.
