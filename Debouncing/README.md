For this assignment, a program must be created to change an LED on or off whenever a button is pressed, while debouncing the signal from the button. To do this, a timer was set up to run at a rate of about 2 ms, in order to prevent the signal from the button from changing multiple times within this period. This would ensure a much cleaner toggling of the LED on each board. AS for the differences between the FR and G2 boards, te only thing that had to be changed within the code was the different pin numbers for the LED and button.
